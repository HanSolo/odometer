## Odometer
A JavaFX library containing an odometer and two spinner controls.

The odometer control is a simple counter where the number of digits and the number of decimals can be defined.
The background and foreground color for digits and decimals can be defined separately.

The spinner controls are in principle single digit odometers where you can define different types of spinner types.
There are types that counts from 0-9 or 0-5 and others that count from A-Z.

In the provided Demo classes you will find more info on how to use them.

The Spinner controls are the same controls but one is based on Canvas where the other is based on ImageView.
